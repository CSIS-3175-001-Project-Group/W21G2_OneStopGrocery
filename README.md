**Run the Android App on Emulator â€“**

Android Emulator allows testing a mobile application on a variety of devices without needing a physical device.

Testing a mobile app on the emulator is faster and easier than doing so on a physical device. At first, we must create an Android Virtual Device (AVD) on your Android Studio to install and run the application. 

In the toolbar, you can choose the AVD that you want to run your app on from the target device drop-down menu.

**Run the App on Real Android Phone -**

Since we have not released our mobile application on google play store, users cannot download and install our application on their mobile phones through google play store. But they can manually install our mobile application. We are using Xiaomi Mi A2 Lite android operating system based mobile device to demonstrate how users can install our mobile application on their Android phones.

*Step 1*

The first thing users have to do is go to the option called "Settings" on the user's phone and click on the settings twice to enter the settings window.

*Step 2*

Once the user is in the settings window, he/she should go to the bottom of the options and choose the tab called "System."

*Step 3*

When the user is inside the system options window, the user must press the "Build number" tab at the bottom 7 times.

*Step 4*

By pressing the previous option repeatedly, the user will notice that a small window gives you the information that the developer's options have been enabled.

*Step 5*

Within the system window, we will find several more options. One of these options is called "Options for developers"; we just have to select that option. Once the user is in the developer options window, the user must enable the option called "USB Debugging", and the user can simply do it by selecting this option.

*Step 6*

Once the user accepts, the box of options for developers is active, from this moment, we can already connect the Xiaomi phone to the computer. Now, just run the application via android device and your application would be installed on our device.
